# MovieMetrix

MovieMetrix is a personalized movie recommendation system built using Streamlit. The application leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning to provide tailored movie recommendations based on user preferences and moods.

## Features

- **Personalized Recommendations**: Input your movie preferences and get a list of recommended movies based on cosine similarity.
- **Mood-Based Recommendations**: Enter your current mood to receive movie recommendations that match your sentiment using TextBlob sentiment analysis.
- **Filter Movies**: Filter movies by director, actor, or genre for more targeted recommendations.
